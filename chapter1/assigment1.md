# Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

## Prompt
Tell us about an embedded system that does not exist. It can be grandiose or strange; it can be
something just one step beyond what you have around you. Ideally it is something you
personally want to build (even if physics doesnâ€™t allow it). What is it? What does it do? What
general components do you need?

## Problem Statement
To continue to explore dangerous unknown lands we should find disposable solutions to survey the land before we send people.

## Solution
Create a swarm of Hexapods which communicate with each other to plot out an area.

### Why a Hexapod?
This platform has increased stability and mobility when the terrain is uneven.

## Details

### MCU
A compute unit capable of SLAM is required for this project to parse the sensor data in realtime and provide movement commands to motor controller.

### Sensors
Both Lidar and an IR Camera are used for mapping out the area. This allows imaging in a low light environment.

### Communication
Wireless communication is required to transfer data between each robot, in this case Bluetooth is used.

### Impossible Aspect
The impossible part of this project is the software architecture that can handle near perfect SLAM using a multi robot approach where each robot is transmitting its "map" to the rest of the group so one map can eventually be returned to the survey team.
