## Make Blinky Prompt
What are the hardware registers that cause the LED to turn on and off? (From the processor manual, donâ€™t worry about initialization.) What are the button registers that you read? Can you read that memory directly and see the button change in a debugger or by printing out the associated memory?

![Register Memory Map](RegisterMap.PNG)
Looking at my memory map the built in LEDs use GPIOE so the address would be:
`0x4800 1000`
My button registers use GPIOA so the address would be: `0x4800 0000`

Adding a variable for the register shows the difference in the debugger of unpressed vs pressed:
`unsigned long b = (*(int*)(0x48000010));`

## File Definitions
### Main homework file
*main.c*

The main.c file is from my STMCube32IDE project. Using the `.ioc` file I set my timer and button as an interrupt which generated some of the code for me. Personal additions are called out below

**timerWithBoundsCheck**

Verify delay while handling rollover counter.

**updateLEDs**

My Microcontroller has 8 circular LEDs, I rotate between them.

**updateButtonState**

Handle updating hte button state if the press is after the defined delay period.

**HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback**

Interrupt callback function which updates the button state. Only toggle the button state to keep this function as short as possible and handle actual logic in the main process.
